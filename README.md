## General Information

A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state. 

They have contracted a consulting company to understand the factors on which the demand for these shared bikes depends. Specifically, they want to understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared bikes in the American market. The company wants to know:

    1. Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
    2. How well those variables describe the bike demands

This project analyzes the data and to create a linear regression model for bikes prediction.

## Conclusions
- EDA performed on bikes data
- Top contributing independent variables are captured using RFE algorithm.
- Model trained using statsmodel python library
- metrics like P values and VIF are analyzed for best model.

## Technologies Used
- Pandas library : v1.5.2
- Numpy library : v1.22.3
- Seaborn library : v0.12.2
- Statsmodel library: v0.13.5
